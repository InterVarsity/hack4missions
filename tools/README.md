## Technical Skills

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - Ask a question and get some help, or find answers from other people who have already run into this issue. Often someone else has already tackled that bug or problem you are struggling with, no harm in checking.
- SQLite is perhaps my favorite piece of software, and one of the most widely used in the world. Its authors have placed it in the public domain with a charge/blessing that can be read at the [bottom of this page](http://www.sqlite.org/about.html).
- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is an excellent library for making responsive web applications and pages. No need to mess with all that CSS yourself. Works across pretty much all devices and platforms.
- [Apache Software Foundation ](http://www.apache.org/)- a great source for many free and open source tools and frameworks. You can find all kinds of useful stuff here! If you are looking for a specific thing, look at the [projects list](http://www.apache.org/index.html#projects-list).
- [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) (AKA PhoneGap) is an open source project to write cross platform apps in Javascript, HTML and CSS. It's a great way to build apps for Android, iOS, desktop and more.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is an open source web framework. It is python based and highly configurable. It can be used to power the server side of websites and applications. It works with multiple databases and is a good choice for a backend, especially if you know python.
- [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) is an excellent cross-platform development tool (C++/Python), complete with visual GUI design, thread support, file support, Sql support, OpenGL support, HTTP support, and [QWT](http://qwt.sourceforge.net/) adds graphing.
