## Other

- SQLite is perhaps my favorite piece of software, and one of the most widely used in the world. Its authors have placed it in the public domain with a charge/blessing that can be read at the [bottom of this page](http://www.sqlite.org/about.html). I think the SQLite developers have set a great example here. - Sam Bosley

- [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) is an excellent cross-platform development tool (C++/Python), complete with visual GUI design, thread support, file support, Sql support, OpenGL support, HTTP support, and [QWT](http://qwt.sourceforge.net/) adds graphing. - Russ Taylor
