| Challenge name | Lead/Point of Contact (Slack Username) | Description | Motivation |
| -------------  | -------------------------------------  | ----------- | ---------- |
| Data Visualization for Mobilization | Frontier Ventures | What’s the challenge? Analyze and visualize specific data sets to help viewers deepen their understanding of God’s global mission and their place in it. | What’s great about it? This project is great for people who are interested in data analytics. It will produce a piece that will help mobilize others into missions.
| Talent Matching for Missions | Frontier Ventures | What’s the challenge? Build an online mobile talent-matching system to connect people with opportunities that match their skill set and interests. This would be primarily for alumni of the Perspectives course, but the stretch goal would be a platform to accommodate students and alumni of many different missions or missions-training organizations. | What’s great about it? This project is ideal for anyone interested in thinking about how to engage people in missions in a practical and sustainable way. It would be a great fit for people who want to help think through categories and how to plan a stable platform from the ground up, are interested in HR/ future of work, and have taken the Perspectives course.
| TWR Radio Ministry Monitoring | Trans World Radio (TWR) | What’s the challenge? TWR is developing a global monitoring receiver network to measure and analyze broadcast radio signals as they are received at remote locations, including a single board computer (SBC) solution to automate the timing and control of data-gathering operations. Participants will develop a method to automatically request, extract, and store data from the receiver. | What’s great about it? This is an IoT project for people to get their hands on both hardware and software. It’s great for anyone interested in learning how to apply a particular software client or how to automate data calls. It will also help support TWR share the gospel across the world via radio. |
| Find My Discipler | Pioneers | What’s the challenge? Build a native mobile app for new believers to receive notifications and accept or decline requests for follow-up on discussions of faith and studying the Bible. The app is based on the idea of Uber, where a centralized system sends out requests to all phones within a geographic area. This area is defined by the given contact’s location and the range where follow-up members can travel. | What’s great about it? This project is great for anyone who wants to help wireframe a clear project and bring it to life. This effort was requested by missionaries in the field to help with discipleship in hard-to-reach places. |
| Drone Airstrip Survey Challenge | Mission Aviation Fellowship | What’s the challenge? Provide drones with two reference points and matching the drone navigation system with its programming to autonomously take off, fly an appropriate grid pattern while taking photos, and land at the starting location. Geotagged pictures taken with the drone will be used when photo stitching them together. The photo stitching and 3D mapping will be considered stretch goals for the project. | What’s great about it? This project is great for students experienced in drone applications, GIS/mapping, and photo stitching. This will support MAF in their long-term effort to monitor remote airstrips all over the world and transport workers by air. |
| Missional.Life Mobile Ap | Service Reef | What’s the challenge? Create the ability to log in to the Missional.Life application as well as view and post to the activity feed, either a story or prayer. The stretch goal would be allowing users to create a profile on Missional.Life through create wizard. | What’s great about it? This project will build on an existing API to develop a usable human interface for a project already serving people in lots of places. It’s great for anyone with API experience or who wants to do simple interaction design while serving a Christian organization. |
| Propensity Model for Successful Evangelization | Cru | What’s the challenge? Given an anonymized set of clickstream data (40 million events from Cru.org), predict the likelihood that someone will engage with missional content, like a gospel presentation, and accept Christ.  Then use your prediction to build a recommendation engine to help them grow in their faith by recommending their next best step on their spiritual journey (i.e. read an article, attend an event, take a step of faith, etc).  Build predictive models that enable more people to engage with the Gospel and increase their likelihood to see and savor Christ. |What’s great about it? This project is great for anyone who wants to develop algorithms or develop and apply data insights. This is a practical experience in using a ministry’s data to help draw conclusions about how to more effectively fulfill the Great Commission. |
| Transliteration Dashboard | Wycliffe | What’s the challenge? Build a mobile React dashboard where users type their names in a text field, and names are automatically translated into various, specified languages. | What’s great about it? This project is great for anyone interested in linguistics, communications, marketing, and promotion. Anyone with experience in React would be very helpful. This will help Wycliffe show others the value and urgency of its mission translating Scripture. |
| Automation of Bible Story Video Creation | SIL | What’s the challenge? Given inputs, create automation that will extract Scripture in text and audio form, and then insert it into the Bible story template. This will allow another process to generate a video from the Bible story that will be uploaded to a website where people can access the Bible story video in their language. | What’s great about it? This project is great for anyone interested in storytelling, video creation, or editing. This will support SIL as they explore new formats for communicating the story of the Bible to those who might be illiterate, preliterate, or just not have the Bible in their language. |
